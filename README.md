üåæ Zambo AgriMap
Zambo AgriMap is a web-based agricultural and geo-mapping system designed to support the rice farming sector in Zamboanga City. The system leverages Geographic Information System (GIS) technology to centralize, manage, and visualize critical agricultural data ‚Äî enabling stakeholders to make informed decisions, monitor productivity, and implement strategic measures for sustainability and growth.

üìå Purpose
The primary goal of Zambo AgriMap is to provide a digital platform that empowers local government units, agricultural officers, and farmers with real-time data insights. By integrating geospatial mapping and agriculture data management, the system enhances planning, resource allocation, and support services aimed at improving rice farming productivity across the city.

üéØ Specific Objectives
GIS-Based Mapping
Utilize GIS technology to create a comprehensive agricultural map of Zamboanga City. This map offers a detailed view of the agricultural landscape and highlights areas with potential for new agricultural development.

Data Collection & Analysis
Gather and analyze key data factors that influence agricultural productivity, such as rice field locations, environmental conditions, and the socio-economic status of farmers in the city.

Interactive Web Platform
Develop a user-friendly web platform that enables users to:

Manage rice field data, including GPS-based locations

Maintain farmer profiles and production records

Track crop yields and generate reports

Use an interactive map to view and plot agricultural fields
The platform is built to be functional, usable, and reliable, and will be evaluated based on these criteria.
